            The Federal Republic of Germany, or Germany as it is known, is
            situated in the central Europe. From the North Sea and the Baltic in
            the north to the Alps in the south, with 349,223 square kilometers
            of land, Germany consists of 16 states and it is one of the largest
            countries in Europe in area. What’s more, Germany has the biggest
            population with more than 80.5 million people among the countries
            that are in the European Union. The fact that Germany is located at
            the heart of Europe means that the country borders nine countries
            and this is the highest number of neighbors that a European country
            has.

          When it comes to economy, Germany is one of the most powerful
          countries in the world. For instance, while Germany has the third
          greatest economy in the world, the country is the best in Europe terms
          of economy thanks to being a leading exporter of machinery, vehicles,
          chemicals and so on. They also have a very skilled labor force. They
          produce automobiles, engineering products, electronic and
          communications equipment and many more products along with these. The
          country ranks as the second biggest car manufacturer after Japan while
          Germany is the world’s leading exporter of goods. <br />
          Germany has a lot of forested hills and mountains. The country is also
          home to the Danube, Main, and Rhine river valleys. The country has a
          very large wooded area and the Swiss border is really important in
          that sense as the Black Forest is located there. <br />
          There are lots of cultural and historical places to visit in Germany
          as the country has a big history. For example, the world’s oldest
          university is Germany. The Heidelberg University was established in
          1386. On the other hand, Germany is famous for Oktoberfest which can
          be considered the world’s biggest fair. Oktoberfest is held in Munich
          every year and it lasts 16 days. Each year, nearly 7 million liters of
          beer is served as well as many kinds of food. <br />
          There are many German people who have contributed to the world’s
          culture and heritage with great inventions or works of art throughout
          history. There are many philosophers and composers who were born in
          Germany. For example, Ludwig van Beethoven, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart,
          Franz Schubert, Georg Friedrich Handel and Johann Sebastian Bach were
          all successful people that came from Germany. On the other hand, the
          light bulb, the calculator and the jet engine were all invented by
          German people.

          <strong>Brot & Brötchen</strong> <br />
          Bread in the form of a loaf (Brot) or a small, usually crusty roll
          (Brötchen), is an important part of the cuisine, which is eaten all
          over the country and served with most German dishes. Bread is enjoyed
          with most meals, especially breakfast and dinner, but also at lunch
          (usually considered the main meal of the day), which will often be
          served with rolls on the side. Germans enjoy a wide variety of bread
          including grain, Pumpernickel, rye, and white bread. German bread
          tends to be heavier and heartier than bread from Italy, Spain, or
          France.<br />
          <strong>Käsespätzle</strong>
          <br />
          A dish from the southwestern regions of Germany, Käsespätzle is made
          from layering small Spätzle pasta with grated cheese and topping with
          fried onion. It is usually served with a salad and sometimes with
          applesauce. Those moving to Germany from the US or Britain will find
          that this is the closest they will get to Macaroni Cheese, and will no
          doubt also find that it has more depth and flavor than their own home
          dish. <br />
          <strong>Zürcher Geschnetzeltes </strong>
          <br />
          This dish, which can be considered the signature of Canton Zürich, is
          made by adding white wine, mushrooms and cream sauce to cubed meat and
          is usually served with rösti.

          <br />
          Berlin, the capital of Germany, is the most visited city in the
          country. Berlin is associated with a rich history and culture that
          attracts tourists from across the globe. 138 museums and over 400 art
          galleries are present in the city. Nearly one-third of the area of
          Berlin is covered by parks, gardens, and forests. Tourism has steadily
          risen in the city. The city recorded 31.1 million overnight stays in
          2016. Some of the most visited places here include the Potsdamer
          Platz, the Berlin wall, Museumsinsel, Französischer Dom, etc. A large
          number of foreign visitors also visit the city for attending
          international conferences, academic events, and business meetings.
          According to a report, in 2015 Berlin hosted 195 international
          meetings.

          <strong style="font-size: 35px; margin-left: 200px">Hamburg</strong>
          <br />
          Hamburg is the country's second-largest city located in the North of
          Germany. Several waterways run through its center and Hamburg has more
          bridges than Amsterdam and Venice combined. It boasts one of the
          biggest harbors in the world and still embraces its gritty, sailor
          past. <br />
          This is most apparent in its red-light district of the Reeperbahn.
          Complete with seedy bars and shops selling stripper boots, this is
          also a hot spot for clubs and music and the place the Beatles got
          their start. <br />
          The surrounding area of St. Pauli is also worth a visit. Spend time on
          the harbor with an early morning visit to the Fischmarkt (fish
          market). This meeting place for locals and tourists alike was started
          in 1703 and sells the freshest fish, flowers, and spices with a side
          of live entertainment. Nearby HafenCity has been newly built up and
          offers the latest in shopping and dining. <br />
          If you hanker for the classic, stick to the city center with its
          elegant neoclassical rathaus (city hall) and its fine shopping street
          of Mönckebergstraße, affectionately known as Mö.
