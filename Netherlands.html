            Netherlands, country located in northwestern Europe, also known as
            Holland. “Netherlands” means low-lying country; the name Holland
            (from Houtland, or “Wooded Land”) was originally given to one of the
            medieval cores of what later became the modern state and is still
            used for 2 of its 12 provinces (Noord-Holland and Zuid-Holland). A
            parliamentary democracy under a constitutional monarch, the kingdom
            includes its former colonies in the Lesser Antilles: Aruba, Bonaire,
            Curaçao, Saba, Sint Eustatius, and Sint Maarten. The capital is
            Amsterdam and the seat of government The Hague.

          The country is indeed low-lying and remarkably flat, with large
          expanses of lakes, rivers, and canals. Some 2,500 square miles (6,500
          square km) of the Netherlands consist of reclaimed land, the result of
          a process of careful water management dating back to medieval times.
          Along the coasts, land was reclaimed from the sea, and, in the
          interior, lakes and marshes were drained, especially alongside the
          many rivers. All this new land was turned into polders, usually
          surrounded by dikes. Initially, man power and horsepower were used to
          drain the land, but they were later replaced by windmills, such as the
          mill network at Kinderdijk-Elshout, now a UNESCO World Heritage site.
          The largest water-control schemes were carried out in the second half
          of the 19th century and in the 20th century, when steam pumps and,
          later, electric or diesel pumps came into use.

          <strong>Poffertjes</strong> <br />
          Probably one of the most famous Dutch dishes, Poffertjes are small
          pancakes, baked in an iron skillet, and traditionally served with
          melted butter and dusted with icing sugar. You can enjoy these all
          year round, but Christmas and New Year are typically the best times to
          have them. The best way to eat them is from a street food van on a
          cold winter's night, wrapped up warm and cosy against the chill. They
          are usually served on paper plates with plastic forks, making a very
          informal but delicious snack.<br />
          <strong>Stamppot </strong> <br />
          One of the main features of Dutch cooking is its warmth and
          heartiness, and Stamppot is one of the best examples of this. It's a
          dish of mashed potatoes combined with root vegetables, like turnip,
          carrot and onion, but it can also include dark, leafy greens like kale
          or spinach. Stamppot is such an old dish (historians believe it dates
          back to the 15th century) that no one is entirely sure of its origin,
          or who created it, but it has become a staple of Dutch cuisine. It's
          perfect to try for dinner on a relaxed evening, and make sure you
          order it the traditional way, with smoked sausage. <br />

          <strong>Oliebollen</strong> <br />
          If there is one thing to be said about traditional Dutch food, it's
          that it's not the healthiest cuisine. But when you are tucking into a
          plate of Oliebollen (Dutch doughnuts), you probably won't care! Their
          name means ‘oil spheres', and they are balls of dumpling batter fried
          in hot oil, and later sprinkled with icing sugar. There are variations
          all over northern Europe, but they originate in the Netherlands.
          Traditionally, they were eaten during yule time by Germanic tribes.
          The tribes would offer baked goods (including Oliebollen) to the
          Germanic goddess Perchta, to pacify her and her evil spirits.

          Wandering along the cobbled streets that line the iconic canals, it is
          easy to see why attractive Amsterdam is one of the most popular
          tourist destinations in Europe. Beautiful gabled buildings and
          charming old bridges are everywhere you look. There are a number of
          world class museums on offer, such as the Rijksmuseum, Van Gogh Museum
          and Anne Frank House. <br />
          Easily navigable on foot, one of the city´s main draws is simply
          wandering alongside its canals or taking a boat trip along their
          peaceful waters. With a youthful vibe and welcoming population, this
          liberal and cosmopolitan city has some atmospheric cafes and
          restaurants. It also has a lively nightlife in the form of clubs, bars
          and coffee shops – while the red-light district is never too far away.
          A fantastic capital city with so much to see and do, just watch out
          for the bikes when crossing the road!

          <br />
          A popular day trip destination, it is easy to see what makes Delft
          such an attractive option. With its lovely medieval center and
          picturesque canals crossed by brick bridges and lined with trees, the
          city is quaint and peaceful. <br />
          Its most famous son, the painter Johannes Vermeer, is just one of many
          who has sung its praises over the ages. Famous for the distinctive
          blue and white tiles and ceramics that are produced here, visiting the
          Delftware factories is popular among tourists. <br />
          But, despite its wealth of beautiful old buildings, it is the
          atmosphere rather than any particular attraction that makes it worth
          visiting. Try and stay for the evening; once the day-trippers have
          left. the city´s canals shimmer delightfully in the lamp light.
