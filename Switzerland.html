            Switzerland, federated country of central Europe. Switzerland’s
            administrative capital is Bern, while Lausanne serves as its
            judicial centre. Switzerland’s small size—its total area is about
            half that of Scotland—and its modest population give little
            indication of its international significance. A landlocked country
            of towering mountains, deep Alpine lakes, grassy valleys dotted with
            neat farms and small villages, and thriving cities that blend the
            old and the new, Switzerland is the nexus of the diverse physical
            and cultural geography of western Europe, renowned for both its
            natural beauty and its way of life. Aspects of both have become
            bywords for the country, whose very name conjures images of the
            glacier-carved Alps beloved of writers, artists, photographers, and
            outdoor sports enthusiasts from around the world.

          There are 7000 lakes in Switzerland. The water in these lakes is so
          clear that you can drink from rivers and lakes. If you can't see the
          bottom of a lake, that lake is considered polluted. 25% of its
          population is foreign. Switzerland has one of the highest rates of
          foreigners of any nation. More than 80% of foreigners living in
          Switzerland are from European countries and almost half of them come
          only from France, Germany, Italy, Portugal. It has 4 national
          languages. French (20.4%), German (64%), Italian (6.5%) and Romansh
          (just over 1%). <br />
          Unemployment rate is low. In 2017 statistics, Switzerland's
          unemployment rate was only around 4.8%. It is the country with the
          highest wages and job security. Switzerland is the third country with
          the highest wages and job security among the Organization for Economic
          Development and Cooperation (OECD) countries. <br />
          Gotthard tunnel in Switzerland is the longest tunnel in the world.
          Switzerland's Gotthard tunnel is the longest in the world at 57km (7km
          longer than the Channel Tunnel between England and France). It took 17
          years to complete. The longest staircase in the world is found in
          Switzerland. This staircase is the longest in the world, with 11,674
          steps and a height of 1,669 m (5,476 ft). The staircase is not open to
          the public, but a public run is held once a year to enjoy the view
          (and break a sweat). It is one of the most expensive places to live.
          Zurich is the third most expensive city in the world. The average
          house price is CHF 13,000 ($13,036) per square meter, while the
          average monthly rental price is: CHF 2,324 ($2,330) for a
          three-bedroom flat. However, the annual salary averages CHF 103,296
          ($103k).

          <strong>Cheese Fondue</strong> <br />
          When you think of Swiss food, the first thing that comes to mind is
          cheese fondue, arguably the most popular dish of Swiss cuisine. This
          dish, which is preferred during the winter months, is prepared by
          adding melted cheese, white wine, garlic, cornmeal and some maraschino
          liqueur, and is served in a ceramic pot with a small portable stove
          underneath. Pieces of bread are stuck in long fondue forks and dipped
          into the fondue and eaten.<br />
          <strong>Rösti </strong>
          <br />
          Rösti, Switzerland's most famous potato dish, is made by frying grated
          potatoes. Crispy on the outside and soft on the inside, this grater is
          added with bacon, onions, cheese and applesauce. <br />
          <strong>Zürcher Geschnetzeltes </strong>
          <br />
          This dish, which can be considered the signature of Canton Zürich, is
          made by adding white wine, mushrooms and cream sauce to cubed meat and
          is usually served with rösti.

          to do and see during your stay. The city is home to some of the
